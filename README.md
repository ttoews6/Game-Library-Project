# TV_Show_Watchlist
Hello, this is my first official project that I built. Even though it's a simple tv show watchlist website, I was able to implement API data and use as the main functionality of my project. I should also note this was also my first time using an API and it was a great learning experience when doing research.

Challenges:
My biggest issues were getting the API search bar functionality working correctly to display the information I wanted but also the information I needed to save into my own database to further manipulate on other pages. Once I got the hang of it, everything else went pretty smooth.
